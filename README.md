### General info
25.09.22. Updates. We create a new version of the template. It is already written in Typescript !
12.03.21 Updates. Great news ! :fire: :heart: \
In this template every time we manually create 7 files for one CRUD logic. Now you can create your CRUD new files at once just using `rest-resource-file-generator` npm module made by me :tophat: \
Here is the link of instructions in npm [rest-resource-file-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rest-resource-file-generator) \
This is a simple Node.js server application boilerplate with CRUD operations simple logic. It provides REST APIs. 
Before using it, please ensure that you've already installed the following programs\

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as server program,\
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) as Node.js package manager,\
[MongoDb](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) as database program.\
If you haven't, these are their links for installing.

## Style guide 
We suggest our ESLint configs which are inspired by AirBnB configs. We are open to any suggestions from contributors if they are inline with our philosophy. \
These ESLint configs are written and tuned for modern JavaScript development. So we donâ€™t support old, outdated JavaScript methods, e.g. 
obj = new Object() this construct because we can just use const obj = {};\

## Architecture guide

The architecture describes a set of aspects and decisions of the software. \
